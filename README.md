## Currency Converter

The Currency Converter project is part of Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp 2023 on Udemy. I made this project as an exercise to test and further improve my JavaScript proficiency by implementing a live currency conversion tool using APIs. The project utilizes HTML, CSS with Bootstrap 5, and JavaScript to create an interface for converting currencies powered by the ExchangeRate API.

### Project Description

The Currency Converter enables users to convert between different currencies by entering an amount and selecting the desired currencies. It provides live conversion results as users type, utilizing the ExchangeRate API to fetch up-to-date exchange rates.

### Challenge Requirement

The project fulfills the following functionalities:

1. Input field for entering the amount to be converted.
2. Dropdowns or selectors for choosing source and target currencies.
3. Live display of converted currency based on user input.
4. Validation to ensure the entered amount is a valid number, displaying an error message if for example characters are entered.

### Implementation Details

This project is developed using HTML, CSS with Bootstrap 5, and JavaScript. It interacts with the ExchangeRate API to retrieve live exchange rate data, enabling dynamic currency conversion based on user inputs.
